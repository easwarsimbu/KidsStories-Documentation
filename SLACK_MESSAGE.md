🚀 **KidsStories.AI** — Autonomous Content Generation Platform

We've built a fully autonomous system that generates, synthesizes, deploys, and updates content production **without human intervention**.

**What it does:**
• AI generates structured stories (GPT-4o)
• Synthesizes character illustrations (DALL-E 3)
• Produces voice narration (Azure TTS)
• Renders animated videos (Runware – 8 models)
• Uploads to cloud storage (Azure Blob)
• Triggers CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
• Deploys live globally (Container Apps → CDN)

**All autonomously. Daily. Zero manual steps.**

🏗️ **Tech Stack:**
• **MCP Service Mesh** — Orchestrates 5 independent AI models with shared state
• **Azure Infrastructure** — Container Apps (serverless), Blob Storage, Event Grid, CDN
• **102+ Parameters** — Fine-grained control over narrative, design, themes, and variation
• **Event-Driven Pipeline** — Blob upload triggers instant CI/CD → deployment → global cache purge

📊 **Performance:**
• Content synthesis: ~60-120 seconds
• Cloud upload: ~30 seconds
• Build & deploy: ~3 minutes
• **Total pipeline: ~4 minutes from content ready to live globally**

Built entirely with AI-assisted development. Autonomous. Cloud-native. Ships daily. ✨
